Answer the following:
- Does SNS guarantee exactly once delivery to subscribers?

No, Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) does 
not guarantee exactly-once delivery to subscribers. In certain failure scenarios, messages might be delivered more than once (at-least-once delivery). While rare, it can happen.  

SNS aims for high availability and uses various mechanisms to increase reliability. However, distributed systems can encounter issues (like temporary network partitions or subscriber unavailability) that could lead to duplicate message delivery.  

If exactly-once processing is absolutely critical for your application, you need to implement mechanisms within your subscriber services to handle potential duplicates. This usually involves making your message processing idempotent (meaning processing the same message multiple times has the same effect as processing it once). Techniques like message deduplication using a unique message ID stored in a database or cache are common approaches.  
 
- What is the purpose of the Dead-letter Queue (DLQ)? This a feature available to SQS/SNS/EventBridge.

A Dead-letter Queue (DLQ) is a queue (often an SQS queue) that is used to store messages that 
could not be successfully processed by a service. This is a crucial feature for building reliable and fault-tolerant distributed systems.  

Here's how it works in the context of SNS, SQS, and EventBridge:

    Message Delivery Failure: When a message is sent to a subscriber (e.g., an SQS queue subscribed to an SNS topic, or a Lambda function invoked by EventBridge), and the subscriber fails to process it successfully (due to an error, exception, timeout, or the subscriber being unavailable), the message is not simply lost.

    Redrive Policy: You configure a "redrive policy" (also known as a dead-letter queue configuration) on the service sending the message. This policy specifies the DLQ and the conditions under which a message should be moved to the DLQ. For example, you might specify that after a certain number of failed attempts to deliver the message, it should be moved to the DLQ.

     Message Movement: When the conditions specified in the redrive policy are met, the message is moved from the primary queue or service to the designated DLQ.   

 Analysis and Handling: Messages in the DLQ can then be analyzed to understand why they failed to be processed. You can then take corrective actions, like fixing the error in your subscriber service, manually reprocessing the messages, or archiving them for further review.   

- How would you enable a notification to your email when messages are added to the DLQ?

Let's address your questions about SNS and DLQs.

- How would you enable a notification to your email when messages are added to the DLQ?

There are several ways to get email notifications for messages in a DLQ:

    CloudWatch Alarms and SNS:
        Create a CloudWatch metric for the ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible attribute of your DLQ. This metric represents the number of messages available for processing in the queue.
        Create a CloudWatch Alarm that monitors this metric. Set the alarm to trigger when the number of visible messages in the DLQ is greater than 0 (or some other threshold you define) for a certain period.   

Configure the CloudWatch alarm to send a notification to an SNS topic.  

    Subscribe your email address to the SNS topic.

Lambda Function and Email Service:

    Create a Lambda function that is triggered by messages in the DLQ (using SQS event source mapping).   

        Inside the Lambda function, add code to send an email notification using an email service like Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) when a message arrives in the DLQ.
        The Lambda function would need appropriate IAM permissions to read messages from the DLQ and send emails using SES.

    Third-Party Monitoring Tools:

    Many third-party cloud monitoring and management tools can integrate with AWS services like SQS and CloudWatch. They can provide alerts and notifications based on DLQ activity.  

The CloudWatch alarm approach (option 1) is generally the simplest and most common way to set up email notifications for DLQ messages. It leverages built-in AWS services and requires minimal custom code. The Lambda function approach (option 2) offers more flexibility for customizing the notification content or handling messages in the DLQ before sending the notification.
